<h3> Relationships </h3>
<p>
  To have a good relationship it is a must that you communicate with each other.
  <p>
  We are not kids anymore, you cant expect them to know what is wrong at all times.
<h3> Heartbroken? </h3>


 <p>
You will live and itâ€™s not the end of the world.
<p>
I know it sounds dumb but your life will keep going with or without that person and you just have to accept it.

<p>
Everyone needs to get heartbroken to get better as a person.
<p>
You feel like it's the end of the world because they were your everything but at the end of the day youre going to depend on yourself to get better.
<p>
You were fine before they came into your life and you will be fine after they leave.
People are either a lesson or a blessing.
<p>
 You are great, you are worth so much more than you think.
 As hard as it sounds YOU will have to pick up the pieces and put yourself back together.
 <p>
 Take some time for yourself to find yourself and love yourself.
 <p>
 During this time, self love is the best love.
 Love yourself before you love anyone else.

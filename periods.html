    <p2> Life Hacks.
The app “Clue” is great for tracking your period.
Always carry an extra pad or tampon just in case. Better safe than sorry!!
Buy hand warmers from walmart or local store and stick them inside the waistband of your pants so you have a heating pad on the go!
Drink lots of water to stay hydrated!

    <p2> Life Hacks.
The app “Clue” is great for tracking your period.
Always carry an extra pad or tampon just in case. Better safe than sorry!!
Buy hand warmers from walmart or local store and stick them inside the waistband of your pants so you have a heating pad on the go!
Drink lots of water to stay hydrated!
DO NOT DRINK COFFEE! Coffee just makes cramps even worse and thats never good. Instead try for an alternative like tea!
A period kit should be a must. Carry one in your locer or purse.
Things it might include:
- pads or tampons
- advil or any medication you take.
- an extra pair of underwear if you want.

      <p1> My name is Jessica Yu. I am a rising junior at Carlmont High School in Belmont.
        I play lacrosse and viola. I enjoy coding and learning new things. I'm glad I joined the Girls Who Code summer immersion program
      and had the chance to surround myself with many female coders. <p1> <h4> jessicayu62@gmail.com </h4> </figcaption>

        <p1> My name is Emilia Dougherty, I am a rising senior attending Notre Dame
          High School in Belmont. I play basketball and love spending time with friends and family.
          Girl Who Code has given me the opportunity to learn to code with very intelligent young women
        and has made me realize I want to pursue computer science as my major and as a career.  <p1>
